# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The project goals consistented of understanding how Airbnb listing price changed by various feature sets available in the data. 

## Process
### Step 1: Understand Data - In this step I reviewed available data and created hypothesis' based on the data
### Step 2: Analyze Data - In this step I created visual models based on the data, compared models against the hypothesis, and refined models where necessary
### Step 3: Create Dashboard ; Selected relevant graphs to create a dashboard that answers the project goal  

## Results
I picked Option #2, specifically focusing on the AirBNB dataset. To answer my overarching project goal I created three (3) hypothesis' with supporting questions for each one:

### Hypothesis #1: Price will vary by Zip Code with Manhattan constituting the greatest price premium
#### Visuals Created: 
- Price by Zip Code
- Beds by Zip Code
- Price by Room Type
- Price by Bed

### Hypothesis #2: Room and property type will have a major impact on listing price
#### Visuals Created:
- Count Room Type
- Count Property Type

### Hypothesis #3: Review quantity and scores will have a positive correlation with price
#### Visuals Created:
- Revenue by Quarter
- Number Reviews & Price
- Review Score & Price

The final dashboard I created had three (3) views and one (1) filter:

Filter: Number of Beds
View #1: Average Price by Number of Beds
View #2: Average Price by Room Type & Total Listings by Room Type
View #3: Geographic map of New York City with prices and Zip Codes

## Challenges 
The following project challenges were encountered:

1) Lack of date variable - this prevented ternding any data over time. Although there was a date (when hosts joined) this does not fully correlate to a time trend. I attempted to analyze revenue by join date but this was not an accurate measure I felt comfortable including the final product
2) Limited dataset - The data only consisted of 34,000 listings which resulted in outliers. It was unclear if the units were simply listed or actually rented, which could affect the analysis results
3) Limited dashboard space - The project limited us to one dashboard, which meant being selective with the final visuals presented. Ideally having access to additional dashboard space could provide a more comprehenensive analysis

## Future Goals
The following future goals would be focused on to address the challenges outlined above:

1) Gather date specific data - Having a date column instead of join date by host would significantly expand what can be done with this analysis
2) Obtain additional data - By having additional data this would remove outliers, add validiity to the model, and further expand the analysis
3) Create multiple dashboards - Based on Goals #1 & #2, I would create additional dashboards for a more dynamic final output
